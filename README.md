# Analysis Programs of Kinect-Based Motion Data for MATLAB (Windows 11 & NVIDIA, with KinZ-Matlab)
These programs were developed for analyzing kinect-based motion data recorded by Azure Kinect and MATLAB with KinZ-Matlab (by J.Treven, https://github.com/jrterven/KinZ-Matlab).  


## Preparation for Analizing Kinect-Based Motion Data

### Installation of SDK
1. CUDA (For NVIDIA) (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?/)  
2. Azure Kinect SDK (https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md)  
3. Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-download)  

### Installation and Modification of KinZ-Matlab
1. Setting up Environmental Variables  
2. KinZ-Matlab (https://github.com/jrterven/KinZ-Matlab)  
3. Modifying bodyTrackingDemo.m
