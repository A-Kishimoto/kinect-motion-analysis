# Analysis Programs of Kinect-Based Motion Data for MATLAB (Windows 11 & NVIDIA, with KinZ-Matlab)
These programs were developed for analyzing kinect-based motion data recorded by Azure Kinect and MATLAB with [KinZ-Matlab](https://github.com/jrterven/KinZ-Matlab) (by J.Treven).  


## Preparation for Analizing Kinect-Based Motion Data

### Installation of SDK
1. CUDA (For NVIDIA) ([Download CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?/))  
2. Azure Kinect SDK ([Download Azure Kinect SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md))  
3. Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK ([Download Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-download)))  

### Installation and Modification of KinZ-Matlab
1. Setting up Environmental Variables  
2. KinZ-Matlab ([Download KinZ-Matlab](https://github.com/jrterven/KinZ-Matlab))  
3. Modifying bodyTrackingDemo.m
